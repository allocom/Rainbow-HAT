Rainbow pHAT Examples
=====================

The examples in this folder must be run with `sudo`, like so:

    sudo ./rainbow.py

or

    sudo python rainbow.py


The examples in this folder are intended for the Rainbow pHAT and are not adapted for the HAT geometry.

rainbow.py
----------

This was the first and only pHAT example at release time and was formally known as 'phat_rainbow.py'. It demonstrates the use of `colorsys` to animate through colour hues and is mosty redundant at this point with the now Unified HAT and pHAT 'rainbow.py'.
